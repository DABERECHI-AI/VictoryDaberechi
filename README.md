- Stage 1: Master Python and Core Libraries  
- Stage 2: Math Fundamentals ➡ Algebra, statistics, probability (Current Stage)  
- Stage 3: Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Stage 4: Key Concepts of Deep Learning
- Stage 5: Learn to Deploy ML models
- stage 6: MLOps
- Stage 7: Specialize



 🔥 Current Focus  
- Mastering core math skills for Machine Learning  
- Documenting my progress on [[YouTube](your-youtube-link)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0GgBw3q1-GO2RZBDyMxOsw) & www.linkedin.com/in/victory-daberechi-7783382a9
- Building foundational problem-solving skills for AI/ML  



 📌 Featured Projects (Coming Soon) 
I’ll be uploading:
